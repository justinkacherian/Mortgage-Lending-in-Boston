-This project worked with the Housing Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data to showcase the nuance of mortgage lending based on a person's characteristics. Much of these findings were summarized in Stock and Watson's text, "Introduction to Econometrics." The first part of the project was to replicate the simple Linear Probability Model, Probit and Logit equations in the text and analyze them. The second part of the project was to replicate and analyze the data summary table, 11.2, in the text. This was done using stata.
